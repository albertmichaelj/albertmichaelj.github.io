            <h2>About me</h2>
	    <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>I am from the mountains of Virginia, from a college town named Harrisonburg. I grew up spending my time either skiing in the winter or swimming in the summer. I went to college in my hometown, at James Madison University, and went from there to Japan for a year to teach math and science at an English speaking high school. From there I started my academic career as a PhD student at Duke University. The rest you can see from my CV.</p>

	    <p>In a past life, I was an avid rock climber. I particularly enjoyed multi-pitch traditional climbing, and you can see a picture of me climbing at Stone Mountain in North Carolina. I still climb occasionally, but my primary way to get out of the office and get moving these days is running. I have run a marathon, but I lost four toenails in the process, so I primarily stick to 5k and 10k runs these days. I also enjoy cooking and traveling, and I have developed a surprisingly robust interest in system administration through maintaining my own linux server, nicknamed "the cyclon" by my wife.</p>

	  <hr class='featurette-divider'>
	  <p>My wife of four years, and the love of my life, was also a climber, and we got to know each other through climbing. We even got engaged at the top of climb! She now works as a mental health counselor with, primarily, latino populations.
	  </p>

	  <p>The reason that we <i>were</i> climbers, is due to a recent addition to our little family. Little Eleanor joined us January of 2017, and she has turned our world upside down in all the best ways. She is, <i>objectively</i>, the cutest baby that has ever lived (to any potential employers who are reading this and also have a baby, I will not back down on this statement). We look forward to the day when she is old enough to get out on the rock.</p>
